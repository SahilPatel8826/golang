Go, also called Golang or Go language, is an Open Source programming language that Google developed. Software developers use Go in an array of operating systems and frameworks to develop web applications, cloud and networking services, and other types of software.

Go is statically typed, explicit and modeled after the C programming language. Because of Go language's fast startup time, low runtime overhead and ability to run without a virtual machine (VM), it has become a very popular language for writing microservices and other uses. In addition, Go is used for concurrent programming -- a strategy to execute multiple tasks at one time, out of order or in partial order.

Go language was inspired by the productivity and relative simplicity of Python. It uses goroutines, or lightweight processes, and a collection of packages for efficient dependency management. It was designed to solve several problems, including slow build time, uncontrolled dependencies, effort duplication, difficulty writing automatic tools and cross-language development.

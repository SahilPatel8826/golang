Google created Go to solve its own software engineering issues and provide an alternative to C++. Also, a language with higher productivity levels was needed at the time as multicore processors became more popular.

Google began designing Go in 2007. Go developers wanted to create a programming language that was easier to use, but still had the useful characteristics found in other languages such as C++, Python and JavaScript. Go was announced in 2009 as an open source project where community members could collaborate on ideas and code. Version 1.0 was later released in 2012.

Over the years, new updates and features were added, such as generics in 2022. Go's popularity has continued to grow as it is used by high-profile companies, such as Google, Cloudflare, Dropbox, MongoDB, Netflix, SoundCloud, Twitch and Uber.
